## Assignment
Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game.
The game should be playable in the command line.
You can choose how you want your game to look. The simplest is to create a game board using "|" and "_" symbols. But the design is up to you.
If you have more time, you can challenge yourself to build an AI player to play the game with you.
